Role: Automysqlbackup set up
============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Blue-Bag/ansible-role-automysqlbackup.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Blue-Bag/ansible-role-automysqlbackup)

Install Automysqlbackup Role and configure.

This role enables you to install and configure Automysqlbackup.
It gives you the option of installing from package manager or
from a repo.
The latest version of Automysqlbackup is not in the repos typically and therefore
to use the latest version you need toinstall from a repo.
I have placed a fork of automysqlbackup on github in case other sources disappear.
The main reason for using the latest version is that it avoids errors in trying to back up events tables etc.

The role also enables you to provide scripts for pre and post backup tasks.
Typically these are used (e.g. post) for pushing the backups off server.
